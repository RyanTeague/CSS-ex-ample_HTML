    <!--HTML Style - CSS
    
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages
        all at once.
    -->

    <!--Whis is CSS?
    
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is uesed to format the layout of a webpage.

        With CSS, you can control the color, fornt, the size of text, the spacing
        between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what
        background images or background colors are to be used, different displays
        for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

        Tip: The word Cascading means that a style applied to a parent element
        will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the
        color of the body text to "blue" , all headings, paragraphs, and other text
        elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify
        something else)!

    <!--Using CSS
    
        CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

        . INLINE - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
        . INTERNAL - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
        . EXTERNAL - by using a <linkn> element to link to an external CSS file

        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS
        files. However, in this case we will use inline and internal style, because
        this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for us to try it
    -->

    <!--Inline CSS
    
        An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

        An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
        
        The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and
            the text color of the <p> element to red:
    -->

    <h1 style="color: blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

    <p style="color: red;">A red paragraph.</p>

    <hr>

    <!--Internal CSS
    
        An internal CSS is used to define a styel for a single HTML page.

        An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a
        <style> element.

        The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that
        page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In
        addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color:
