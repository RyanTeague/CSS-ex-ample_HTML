    <!--HTML Style - CSS
    
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages
        all at once.
    -->

    <!--Whis is CSS?
    
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is uesed to format the layout of a webpage.

        With CSS, you can control the color, fornt, the size of text, the spacing
        between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what
        background images or background colors are to be used, different displays
        for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

        Tip: The word Cascading means that a style applied to a parent element
        will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the
        color of the body text to "blue" , all headings, paragraphs, and other text
        elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify
        something else)!

    <!--Using CSS
    
        CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

        . INLINE - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
        . INTERNAL - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
        . EXTERNAL - by using a <linkn> element to link to an external CSS file

        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS
        files. However, in this case we will use inline and internal style, because
        this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for us to try it
    -->

    <!--Inline CSS
    
        An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

        An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
        
        The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and
            the text color of the <p> element to red:
    -->

    <h1 style="color: blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

    <p style="color: red;">A red paragraph.</p>

    

    <!--Internal CSS
    
        An internal CSS is used to define a styel for a single HTML page.

        An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a
        <style> element.

        The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that
        page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In
        addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color:
    -->

    <!--External CSS
    
    An External Style Sheet is used to defined the style for many HTML pages.

    To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each
    HTML page:
    -->

    <h1>This is a heading</h1>

    <p>this is a paragraph</p>

    <!--The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The File must not
        contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.
    -->

    <!--Tip: With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, 
        by changing one file !
    -->
    <!--CSS COlors, Fonts and Sizes
    
        Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will
        learn more about later.

        The CSS color property defines the text color to be sued.

        The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.

        The CSS font-size property defines the test size to be used
    -->

    <hr>

    <!--CSS Border
    
        The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.

        Tip: you can define a border for nearly all HTML element.

        p {
            border: 2px solid powderblue;
            padding: 30px
        }
    -->

    <!--CSS Margin
    
        The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.

        p {
            border: 2px solid powderblue;
            margin: 50px;
        }
    -->

    <!--Link to External CSS
    
        External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative
        to the current web page.

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css">

        This Example links to a style sheet in the html folder on the current 
        web site

        <link> rel="stylesheet" href="/html/style.css"
    -->

    <!--This example links to a style sheet located in the same folder as the current
        page:

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    -->

    <!--Chapter summary

        . use the HTMl <style> element to define internal CSS

        . use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
        . use the CSS color property for text colors
        . use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
        . use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
